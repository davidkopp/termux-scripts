# How to contribute

I'm happy to accept pull requests!

When modifying a shell script, please make sure that there are no errors or warnings when checked with [ShellCheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/). You can use ShellCheck in many different ways. I personally use the [ShellCheck for Visual Studio Code extension](https://github.com/vscode-shellcheck/vscode-shellcheck).
